<h1> K Means </h1>
</br>
<p>Set student data for <b>unsupervised ML</b> using K-Means algorithm to clustering student data to three categories. Student data will contain (GPA - Attendance Hours - Financial Aid)</p>
</br>
<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>Use three clusters with three colors red, green and blue. Clusters will be represented as a triangle on the graph, and other data will be represented as a circle. The points which will be choosed by a cluster will hold the same cluster's color.

  <li>
    Set each cluster at a random position, and set corresponding data.

<ol>
<li>The first cluster-<b>red color</b>- has students who had attendance hours in range 14~20 hours, and  71% from those studnets hadn't a financial aid and has median GPA: 2.89.</li>
<li>The first cluster-<b>green color</b>- has students who had attendance hours in range 0~5 hours, and  11% from those studnets hadn't a financial aid and has median GPA: 2.48.</li>
<li>The first cluster-<b>blue color</b>- has students who had attendance hours in range 6~14 hours, and  21% from those studnets hadn't a financial aid and has median GPA: 2.19.</li>
